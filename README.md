# George's Chat App
## [gp3-chat-app.herokuapp.com](https://gp3-chat-app.herokuapp.com/)
### Basic chat app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

Initially I thought the app may take 2-3 hours to get basic functionality up and running, but it ended up taking maybe just over an hour.

Since getting it functioning and deployed, I've been doing some basic refactoring and adding some styling.
